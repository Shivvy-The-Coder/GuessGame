# GuessGame
This Java game lets players guess a random number (1-100) with 3 difficulty levels. Easy (8Lives), medium (5 lives), and hard (3 lives) provide varied challenges. Clear rules, feedback on guesses, and a restart option ('true' or exit with 'false') enhance the gaming experience. The code's structure is organized for readability and player enjoyment.
